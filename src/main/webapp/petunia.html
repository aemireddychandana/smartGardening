  <h1>Petunia Growing Guide</h1>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<p>Any fertile soil with excellent drainage.</p>
<h3>Position</h3>
<p>Full sun to partial shade.</p>
<h3>Frost tolerant</h3>
<p>Very slight. Established plants in a sheltered location can sometimes survive winter in mild climates.</p>
<h3>Feeding</h3>
<p>Mix a standard application of a balanced organic fertilizer into the soil prior to planting along with a generous helping of well-rotted compost. Fertilize established petunias monthly from midsummer to fall.</p>
<h3>Spacing</h3>
<p><b>Single Plants:</b>11" (30cm) each way (minimum)
<b>Rows:</b>9" (25cm) with 1' 1" (35cm) row gap (minimum)</p>
<h3>Sow and Plant</h3>
<p>Many excellent petunia varieties can be grown from seed, or you can start with plants grown from rooted cuttings. Petunia seeds are small but easy to handle. The seedlings need bright light to grow well. Most gardeners buy petunias as inexpensive bedding plants, set out in spring as soon as danger of frost has passed. Large varieties may need wider spacing, or you can grow them in 14-inch (35cm) diameter containers.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Few pests bother petunia's, which are members of the nightshade family. Mites, leaf miners and budworms cause occasional problems.</p>
