  <h1>Lantana Growing Guide</h1>
<h3>Soil</h3>
<p>Any fertile soil with excellent drainage.</p>
<h3>Position</h3>
<p>Full sun.</p>
<h3>Frost tolerant</h3>
<p>Very limited. A few lantana varieties will persist as perennials where winters are mild, but most are killed by hard freezes.</p>
<h3>Feeding</h3>
<p>Mix a standard application of a balanced organic fertilizer into the soil prior to planting along with a generous helping of well-rotted compost. When growing lantana in containers, use a coarse potting soil that drains well.</p>
<h3>Spacing</h3>
<p><b>Single Plants:</b>11" (30cm) each way (minimum)
<b>Rows:</b>9" (25cm) with 1' 1" (35cm) row gap (minimum)</p>
<h3>Sow and Plant</h3>
<p>Only a few lantana varieties are available as seed, but it is better to start with vegetatively propagated plants because they are seed sterile and cannot become weedy. Most gardeners buy lantanas as bedding plants, which are sold in late spring and early summer as warm-weather bedding plants. Large varieties may need wider spacing, or you can grow them in 14-inch (35cm) diameter containers.</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Lantana's that dry out often can be brought back to life with regular water and fertilizer.</p>
